### Overview

The concept is to create a narrative based educational-game to familiarize patients receiving a bone marrow transplant with the procedure in an engaging and destigmatizing environment. Topics covered in the game are tied to factors affecting the transplant procedure, the medical procedure itself, and an empathetic standpoint on patient care and recovery. The gameplay is through the perspective of a practitioner, who must accomplish tasks through puzzle and logic mini-games, with the ultimate goal of completing a patientâ€™s treatment and moving on in their journey to becoming a licensed doctor.
