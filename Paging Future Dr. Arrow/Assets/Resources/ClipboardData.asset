  - "\t\tIntro to Bone Marrow transplant\n\tChapter 1: The Pre-Transplant Evaluation\r\n\nObjective:\n\tUnderstand
    what bone marrow does and why a transplant might be needed. While also learning
    the science behind a donor match.\r\n"
  - "Bone Marrow Transplant\r\nWhat is Bone Marrow\r\nBone marrow is the soft, spongy
    tissue inside bones that produces:\r\n\u2022\tRed blood cells (carry oxygen)\r\n\u2022\tWhite
    blood cells (fight infection)\r\n\u2022\tPlatelets (help blood clot)\r\n\r\r\nUsed
    to:\r\n\u2022\tTreat blood cancers (like leukemia, lymphoma, multiple myeloma)\r\n\u2022\tTreat
    bone marrow failure syndromes (like aplastic anemia)\r\n\u2022\tReplace marrow
    destroyed by high-dose chemotherapy or radiation\r\n\u2022\tTreat some genetic
    diseases (like sickle cell disease or thalassemia)\r\n"
  - "Types of Transplants\n\r\n1.\tAutologous Transplant\r\nUses your own stem cells
    (collected before treatment and given back after).\r\n2.\tAllogeneic Transplant\r\nUses
    stem cells from a donor (often a sibling, relative, or matched unrelated donor).\r\n3.\tHaploidentical
    Transplant\r\nUses a partially matched donor (often a parent or child).\r\n4.\tUmbilical
    Cord Blood Transplant\r\nUses stem cells from donated umbilical cord blood.\r\n"
  - "HLA (Human Leukocyte Antigen) is a group of proteins found on most cells in
    your body. They help your immune system recognize which cells belong in your
    body and which are foreign.\n\nIn a transplant, donor HLA markers must closely
    match the recipient\u2019s so the body doesn\u2019t attack the new cells.\n\nHLA
    genes are inherited, so siblings have a 25% chance of being a perfect match."
  - "\tChapter 2: Conditioning (Prep Phase):\r\t\nObjective:\n\tLearn about chemotherapy/radiation
    to suppress the immune system to prevent transplant rejection and destroy diseased
    marrow.\r"
  - "\tChemotherapy travels through the bloodstream, targeting fast-growing cells
    all over the body.\n\nIt destroys:\n\u2022\tDiseased bone marrow cells\n\u2022\tCancer
    cells (like leukemia)\n\u2022\tSome healthy fast-growing cells (which can cause
    side effects)\n\nIn bone marrow transplants:\n\tUsed to \"clean out\" the bone
    marrow, making room for new stem cells.\n\tAlso suppresses the immune system
    to prevent it from attacking the transplanted cells.\r"
  - "\tDebrief of ch 3"
  - "\tChapter 3: The Stem Cell Infusion (Transplant)\nObjective:\n\tUnderstand the
    transplant process (IV infusion of stem cells, post-monitoring). Specifically
    with the stem cells travel through your bloodstream to your bone marrow, where
    they begin to grow in addition to the Engraftment Phase\r\n"
